### INSTRUCTIONS ###
Expense tracker: the user should be able to enter expenses per category
(food, clothing, entertainment, rent, etc) and the application should track
the expenses per week or month.

The user should be able to see their total expenses for a month of their choice
for each category and a total monthly expense.

The monthly expense report should include average expenses for each category for
the year and indicate if the user expense for the month selected is lower or higher
than the annual average.

Also, the report should display the percentage of expenses
from each category out of the total monthly expenses.
